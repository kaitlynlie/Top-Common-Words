# Top Common Words

This terminal-based program written in C++ will help you determine what the top common words are in a text file.

## Running the program
To check the top common words of a file, you will need to copy and paste your text, whether it is song lyrics or paragraphs of an essay, into a .txt file in the same directory as the program. There are some example .txt files in the test files that I had used for testing. Then, you have to name the text file as a program argument in the command line.

For instance, it may look like this: 

`"./Top Common Words/cmake-build-debug/TopCommonWords" your_text_file_here.txt`
